[Unfinished, Final Work] TriMeter - Triathlon Tracking for the Apple Watch

This project was my Final Work for the bachelor Multimedia & Communication Technology at the Erasmus Hogeschool Brussels.

The concept was to let athletes track triathlons with their Apple Watch without having to stop and start a new activity after each segment.

After graduating I left this project because it was not really interesting to myself.

Does it work? Kind of.

You can create custom activities containing 1 or more sports and/or different goals but nothing is done with these activities. You can start a normal or custom activity on the Apple Watch but it's not a guarantee all data gets tracked. Maybe some other things as well, it's been a while.

Keep in mind the last time I tested this project was in August 2018.

Everything has been done by myself, including UI, UX and all development.
